ADVERTIZE: map + A + B + pickup time + cost per head + capacity

so.... negotiation page is similar to advertize... except
negotiation has a list of pending proposals

but im thinking... to setup non negotiable... fcfs booking
so no proposal status, immediate accept

once you establish that, then do the ui then change query
